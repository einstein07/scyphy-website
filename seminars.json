        "abstract": "Developments in physical sciences over the last couple hundred years have enabled us to understand the nature and general tendencies of the matter that comprises much of the observable universe. Missing from this picture, however, is a general understanding of where living things fit in. Life tends to be comprised of active components, who themselves are little open systems interacting in complex ways with each other and their environments and who are consequently not easily described by equilibrium theories like classical Thermodynamics. I'll talk about my work observing large collectives (of locusts and fish) as a kind of 'living matter' as a way to try to improve our understanding of living systems in general.",

        "abstract": "Swarm robots offer fascinating opportunities to perform complex tasks beyond the capabilities of individual machines. Just as a swarm of ants collectively moves large objects, similar functions can emerge within a group of robots through individual strategies based on local sensing. However, realizing collective functions with individually controlled microrobots is particularly challenging because of their micrometer size, large number of degrees of freedom, strong thermal noise relative to the propulsion speed, and complex physical coupling between neighboring microrobots. Here, we implemented multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) to generate a control strategy for up to 200 microrobots whose motions are individually controlled by laser spots. During the learning process, we used so-called counterfactual rewards that automatically assign credit to the individual microrobots, which allows fast and unbiased training. With the help of this efficient reward scheme, swarm microrobots learn to collectively transport a large cargo object to an arbitrary position and orientation, similar to ant swarms. We show that this flexible and versatile swarm robotic system is robust to variations in group size, the presence of malfunctioning units, and environmental noise. In addition, we let the robot swarms manipulate multiple objects simultaneously in a demonstration experiment, highlighting the benefits of distributed control and independent microrobot motion. Control strategies such as ours can potentially enable complex and automated assembly of mobile micromachines, programmable drug delivery capsules, and other advanced lab-on-a-chip applications.",

        "abstract": "The desert locust, a form of grasshopper, is a notorious plague insect. Swarms of locusts can extend over several hundred square kilometers with up to 80 million individuals per km2, posing severe threats to global food security. However, locusts do not always swarm. When food is abundant and population density is low, individuals remain as cryptic and sedentary ‘solitarious’ grasshoppers. Population upsurges and swarming arises when food scarcity in highly populated areas forces locusts to aggregate around limited resources, causing a transition to the ‘gregarious’ swarm-forming phase. Although behavioral and physiological changes associated with crowding have been widely documented, the biological mechanisms mediating the initiation of swarming and collective migrations are not well understood. We combine laboratory swarming assays with virtual reality and RNA sequencing to investigate when and how collective locust marching emerges. We use motion capture technology to continuously monitor the behaviour of solitary locusts during their first exposure to marching bands of gregarious conspecifics across several days. Preliminary findings suggest that, while rapid changes in response to conspecifics can be observed within a few hours, these do not appear sufficient to drive persistent phenotypic changes. Instead, solitary locusts displayed instances of marching-like behaviour after one day of crowding and started continuously marching only after multiple days of exposure to conspecifics. Complementary experiments in virtual reality - where individual locusts are embedded within immersive, responsive, and photorealistic virtual swarms with predefined statistics – demonstrate that exposure to moving virtual conspecifics is sufficient to trigger marching behaviour in solitary locusts crowded for three days. Further analyses will provide deeper insights into how changes in individual interaction maps and kinematics can lead to the formation of coordinated marching events.",

After the successful implementation of a robot capable of passive echolocation, the necessary following step was to give the very same robot the facilities to echolocate by actively emitting loud ultrasonic calls and processing their echoes, just as bats and other animal species do continuously to move in their surroundings. For this reason several pieces of equipment were developed, such as a suitable audio source and a microphone array intended intended to work at ultrasonic frequencies, together with a signal processing chain apt to emulate the behaviour of an echolocating bat on the move. The system built was then characterized regarding its acoustic performances, and its obstacle avoidance behaviour was tested. Having reached a satisfying prototype, this platform will be replicated in the near future to put to test multiple robots echolocating together, to test a multitude of variables which can influence the achievement of a successful acoustically mediated collective movement.",

Because there is no well established automated way of detecting ozone exposure in plants, we propose a generic automatic toolchain that selects a high-performance subset of features and highly accurate models for plant electrophysiology. This approach derives plantand stimulus-generic features from the electrophysiological signal using the tsfresh library. Based on these features, we automatically select and optimize machine learning models using naive AutoML. We use forward feature selection to increase model performance. We show that our approach successfully classifies plant ozone exposure with accuracies of up to 94.6% on unseen data. We also show that our approach can be used for other plant species and stimuli.

Here, we test the hypothesis that an individual's social dominance can affect sleep opportunities, by studying sleep patterns in a troop of wild chacma baboons (Papio ursinus), a species with a strong hierarchical social structure. First, we show that the troop’s night-time sleep (determined by 40Hz acceleration data) is highly synchronised. Next, we link night-time sleep dynamics to daytime spatial networks and dominance hierarchy (from 1Hz GPS data and direct observations). We show that baboon sleep synchrony is higher between similarly ranked individuals, and unexpectedly, more dominant baboons experience less and lower-quality sleep. We propose that this hierarchy effect is explained by higher-ranked baboons resting closer to more group members, which also leads them exerting greater influence on each other’s night-time behaviour compared to lower-ranked individuals. Our study provides the first empirical evidence for the impact of social hierarchies on sleep in a wild primate, suggesting that dominance status may impose trade-offs between social rank and the quality and quantity of sleep.",

In this work, we explore the implications of predictive coding in a multi-agent system, where each agent moves in a continuous environment and continuously predicts its future state based on sensory inputs. Agents minimize their prediction error by adapting their movement, leading to emergent collective behaviors such as aggregation, cohesion, and obstacle avoidance. Through simulations, we investigate how these behaviors arise from local predictive mechanisms without the need for explicit coordination or predefined interaction rules. Our results show that predictive coding not only enables individual agents to navigate their environment efficiently but also fosters self-organized collective structures that resemble swarm-like behavior observed in natural systems. The findings suggest that predictive coding can serve as a powerful principle for designing distributed intelligent systems capable of adaptive and emergent coordination.",

A major challenge in deploying swarm robotics on a large scale is enabling robots to determine their neighbors' relative positions using onboard sensors, mimicking the spatial awareness observed in animal groups. Current onboard methods, such as SLAM, require intensive computation and are not ideal for decoding neighbor information. On the other hand, combining artificial neural networks with computer vision can be effective when trained on large high-quality datasets, but collecting such datasets remains the primary bottleneck. In this seminar, I propose a general pipeline that simplifies the collection of large training datasets and enables detection with lightweight neural networks to estimate the neighbor's relative position with minimum manual work. As a demonstration, we deploy seven robots equipped with onboard cameras and Raspberry Pi 4B units, using a motion capture system to label neighbors' relative positions synchronized with the onboard images. By collecting more than 10,000 images in just 10 minutes, we train and compare three neural networks to estimate the neighbor's relative position.

Extending these ideas to temporal dynamics, time-delayed mutual information measures coupling across time, while transfer entropy serves as a directional, time-asymmetric tool for identifying effective information flow. The main emphasis is on the theoretical underpinnings of these measures and their interconnections, with applications to key problems in collective animal behavior, such as detecting interaction structures, revealing leader–follower dynamics, and mapping the flow of information underlying coordinated movement.

        "abstract": "Animals provide unique sources of inspiration for robotics, particularly species that rely on non-visual sensing modalities to navigate complex environments. Among them, bats constitute a remarkable model system: they achieve agile flight and coordinated collective motion by relying exclusively on echolocation even within dense swarms where numerous overlapping acoustic signals give rise to the so-called Cocktail Party Problem. Amazed by the ability of bats to navigate and coordinate collectively through sound alone, we developed RO-BAT, a bio-inspired robotic platform designed to investigate how sound-based sensing can be translated into robotic systems for navigation and swarm coordination. The first stage of the project focused on passive sound localisation, in which the robot localises external sound sources without emitting its own signals. Drawing inspiration from bats’ ability to estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of acoustic cues, a microphone array was integrated with a Raspberry Pi and a sound card to enable real-time, onboard signal processing for obstacle avoidance. Three DOA algorithms were implemented and evaluated in controlled experiments, achieving reliable obstacle avoidance in dynamic multi-agent scenarios. This work established a proof of concept for sound-only navigation in robots, demonstrating particular value when visual sensing is unreliable or unavailable. Building on this foundation, the second stage implemented active echolocation, equipping the RO-BAT with an ultrasonic transducer for emission and a custom-built microphone array optimised for ultrasound localisation. A signal processing pipeline was developed to extract both range and angular information from echoes. Several DOA algorithms were tested and Delay-and-Sum (DAS) was selected for its computational efficiency. Laboratory experiments confirmed that the robot could autonomously avoid obstacles using only its self-generated acoustic cues, effectively reproducing the core principles of bat echolocation on a robotic platform. The current implementation of a single functioning RO-BAT—developed in both its passive and active configurations—is now being scaled up into a swarm of autonomous, decentralised agents. This swarm of individually controlled RO-BATs is already capable of navigating cluttered environments acoustically, without relying on any other sensory cues. By modelling both passive and active acoustic localisation, the RO-BAT platform demonstrates a biologically inspired approach to robotic navigation and swarm coordination. Its design highlights how bats’ natural strategies for managing overlapping acoustic signals can lead to scalable, resource-efficient sensing solutions for robotics. This work not only contributes to the study of collective bioacoustics in natural systems, but also paves the way for robust swarm robotic navigation in challenging environments.",

        "image": "images/marco.png",
        "abstract": "Oscillatory dynamics are widespread in animal behaviour. For example, fish periodically increase their swimming speed resulting in a burst-and-glide movement pattern. Following recent studies, we propose a potential functional interpretation to this behaviour by noting that a similar neuro-inspired oscillatory system has favourable decision-making properties. By coupling via non-linear feedbacks a slow variable describing responsiveness to inputs to a set of faster decision variables, a decision-making system can go through periodic cycles of \"exploration\" (gathering evidence) and \"exploitation\" (executing a decision), which emerge intrinsically from the system's dynamics. In this way, decisions are made constantly  \"on the go\", and an individual flexibly and adaptively adjusts to changes in the decisions' landscape. Furthermore, the decision-making system exhibits favourable properties such as spontaneous decisions in the absence of evidence, symmetry-breaking, and is constantly brought back to a state of ultra-sensitivity to the options' qualities. Such properties can be co-opted to develop a bio-inspired control design for effectively guiding the spatial navigation of an artificial agent. In this project, I am expanding a ring attractor model by adding neuro-inspired oscillatory behaviour. The aim is to use this model to potentially describe burst-and-glide movement in fish, and efficiently guide the navigation of a robot through its environment.",

        "abstract": "For a hovering hawkmoth, feeding poses a challenging control problem: the flower moves, the air swirls, and yet the proboscis must be precisely guided to the flower's nectary. Despite this challenge, hawkmoths perform exceptionally well at coordinating their flight movements and proboscis control, with millimetre precision. The hummingbird hawkmoth, Macroglossum stellatarum, serves as an ideal model to investigate the continuous sensing-action loop in flower interactions, as they use visual information to guide movement, which in turn reshapes their sensory input. In this seminar, I will share how we quantify the movements and sensory input of freely flying hawkmoths using high-speed videos and markerless tracking. Then, I will introduce our findings that hawkmoths display individualized strategies of controlling their proboscis while searching for a nectary, using solely visual information. Finally, I will discuss the visuo-motor coordination between the eyes and the proboscis, the plasticity of such systems, and future work in active sensing strategies.",
