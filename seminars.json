        "abstract": "Developments in physical sciences over the last couple hundred years have enabled us to understand the nature and general tendencies of the matter that comprises much of the observable universe. Missing from this picture, however, is a general understanding of where living things fit in. Life tends to be comprised of active components, who themselves are little open systems interacting in complex ways with each other and their environments and who are consequently not easily described by equilibrium theories like classical Thermodynamics. I'll talk about my work observing large collectives (of locusts and fish) as a kind of 'living matter' as a way to try to improve our understanding of living systems in general.",

        "image": "images/Veit-Lorenz_Heuthe.JPG",
        "abstract": "Swarm robots offer fascinating opportunities to perform complex tasks beyond the capabilities of individual machines. Just as a swarm of ants collectively moves large objects, similar functions can emerge within a group of robots through individual strategies based on local sensing. However, realizing collective functions with individually controlled microrobots is particularly challenging because of their micrometer size, large number of degrees of freedom, strong thermal noise relative to the propulsion speed, and complex physical coupling between neighboring microrobots. Here, we implemented multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) to generate a control strategy for up to 200 microrobots whose motions are individually controlled by laser spots. During the learning process, we used so-called counterfactual rewards that automatically assign credit to the individual microrobots, which allows fast and unbiased training. With the help of this efficient reward scheme, swarm microrobots learn to collectively transport a large cargo object to an arbitrary position and orientation, similar to ant swarms. We show that this flexible and versatile swarm robotic system is robust to variations in group size, the presence of malfunctioning units, and environmental noise. In addition, we let the robot swarms manipulate multiple objects simultaneously in a demonstration experiment, highlighting the benefits of distributed control and independent microrobot motion. Control strategies such as ours can potentially enable complex and automated assembly of mobile micromachines, programmable drug delivery capsules, and other advanced lab-on-a-chip applications.",

In Boston, USA, I worked with Prof. Carlo Pinciroli at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) on the development of scalable software infrastructure for swarm robotics, aimed at improving the programmability of large-scale robot collectives. In Granada, Spain, I collaborated with Dr. Héctor García de Marina on the control of multi-drone systems, with a particular focus on the coordination of fixed-wing UAVs operating in decentralized settings. In Bogotá, Colombia, I joined Prof. Félix Mohr at Universidad de La Sabana to explore the use of automated machine learning (AutoML) in the analysis of electrophysiological data from natural plants, investigating plant sensing and signal propagation with ML tools. Finally, in Cape Town, South Africa, I collaborated with Prof. Geoff Nitschke at the University of Cape Town on evolutionary swarm robotics, examining how evolutionary algorithms can be used to design collective robot behaviors (e.g., shepherding). Together, these research stays broadened the scope of my work across swarm robotics, aerial systems, AI for biosignal interpretation, and evolutionary design, while reinforcing the global and interdisciplinary nature of modern swarm robotics research.",

        "image": "images/daniele.jpeg",
        "abstract": "The desert locust, a form of grasshopper, is a notorious plague insect. Swarms of locusts can extend over several hundred square kilometers with up to 80 million individuals per km2, posing severe threats to global food security. However, locusts do not always swarm. When food is abundant and population density is low, individuals remain as cryptic and sedentary ‘solitarious’ grasshoppers. Population upsurges and swarming arises when food scarcity in highly populated areas forces locusts to aggregate around limited resources, causing a transition to the ‘gregarious’ swarm-forming phase. Although behavioral and physiological changes associated with crowding have been widely documented, the biological mechanisms mediating the initiation of swarming and collective migrations are not well understood. We combine laboratory swarming assays with virtual reality and RNA sequencing to investigate when and how collective locust marching emerges. We use motion capture technology to continuously monitor the behaviour of solitary locusts during their first exposure to marching bands of gregarious conspecifics across several days. Preliminary findings suggest that, while rapid changes in response to conspecifics can be observed within a few hours, these do not appear sufficient to drive persistent phenotypic changes. Instead, solitary locusts displayed instances of marching-like behaviour after one day of crowding and started continuously marching only after multiple days of exposure to conspecifics. Complementary experiments in virtual reality - where individual locusts are embedded within immersive, responsive, and photorealistic virtual swarms with predefined statistics – demonstrate that exposure to moving virtual conspecifics is sufficient to trigger marching behaviour in solitary locusts crowded for three days. Further analyses will provide deeper insights into how changes in individual interaction maps and kinematics can lead to the formation of coordinated marching events.",

Our model simulates agents navigating a dynamic energy landscape through glide-soar movement.

After the successful implementation of a robot capable of passive echolocation, the necessary following step was to give the very same robot the facilities to echolocate by actively emitting loud ultrasonic calls and processing their echoes, just as bats and other animal species do continuously to move in their surroundings. For this reason several pieces of equipment were developed, such as a suitable audio source and a microphone array intended intended to work at ultrasonic frequencies, together with a signal processing chain apt to emulate the behaviour of an echolocating bat on the move. The system built was then characterized regarding its acoustic performances, and its obstacle avoidance behaviour was tested. Having reached a satisfying prototype, this platform will be replicated in the near future to put to test multiple robots echolocating together, to test a multitude of variables which can influence the achievement of a successful acoustically mediated collective movement.",
